ReachMaster
=======================================

ReachMaster is a pneumatically-actuated robotic system that supports a variety of rodent reaching tasks. The robot utilizes a modular design that enables up to 3 positional degrees of freedom (1 linear + 2 rotational), and is able to accurately and rapidly position rewards within a large workspace in front of freely moving, or restrained animals.
