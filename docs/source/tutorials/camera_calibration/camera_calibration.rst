Camera Calibration
=======================================

Transforming multiple estimates of 2-D pose (camera scenes) into a 3-D pose (real life, euclidean coordinates) is a
classic problem within computer vision. We prefer our method for pose estimation to be robust across a large volume,
amenable to a 3+ camera configuration, and practical in nature. This has led Bouchard Lab to use the
field calibration method of DLT triangulation as a means of producing 3-D pose estimations from our multiple 2-D pose data sources.
