Hardware
=======================================
Here you will find a detailed list of parts, build instructions, and discussion of alternative design choices.

Enclosure

The enclosure houses the experiments and is made up of two compartments. The leftmost is a behavioral compartment which houses the animals. The rightmost is a hardware compartment which houses the robot and other peripheral devices (i.e., lights, solenoid, etc.). The CAD assembly for the enclosure can be found at:
<https://github.com/BouchardLab/ReachMaster/blob/master/hardware/designs/rat_enclosure.iam>
The entire assembly is constructed from extruded aluminum (i.e., 80/20). This offers a high degree of modularity and adjustability. For example, the relative positioning of the animal and robot can be easily adjusted, and there are many options for connecting or removing peripheral hardware. 80/20 is pretty straightforward to work with; however, it is highly recommended to go over the company's many tips and tutorials:
