Here you will find a detailed list of parts, build instructions, and discussion of alternative design choices.

Enclosure

The enclosure houses the experiments and is made up of two compartments. The leftmost is a behavioral compartment which houses the animals. The rightmost is a hardware compartment which houses the robot and other peripheral devices (i.e., lights, solenoid, etc.). The CAD assembly for the enclosure can be found `here. <https://github.com/BouchardLab/ReachMaster/blob/master/hardware/designs/rat_enclosure.iam>`

The entire assembly is constructed from extruded aluminum (i.e., 80/20) and fastened using mostly anchor fasteners. This offers a high degree of modularity and adjustability. For example, the relative positioning of the animal and robot can be easily adjusted, and there are many options for connecting or removing peripheral hardware. 80/20 is pretty straightforward to work with; however, it is highly recommended to go over the company's many tips and tutorials:

The behavioral compartment is relatively large at 24"x24"x38" (lwh). These dimensions were chosen with a range of `in vivo` neurophysiology experiments in mind. For example, the base dimensions are suitable for free-foraging hippocampal place cell or entorhinal grid cell experiments. The height was chosen so that a recording tether could reach all corners of the compartment without causing too much strain on the animal's head. 

Currently, the enclosure has two primary configurations: one for freely behaving animals, and a second for restrained animals. The configuration shown in the image above corresponds to the restrained condition. In that case, the body and/or head retraining device is merely placed inside the behavioral compartment, and the animal is given unimpeded access to the robot. In the free-moving condition, a plexiglass wall is inserted between the behavioral and hardware compartments. The animals is then allowed to freely explore the behavioral compartment and must reach through a slot in the plexiglass in order to interact with the robot.
