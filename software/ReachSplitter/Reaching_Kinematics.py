    This code is intended to provide utility functions for kinematic quantification of rat reaching behaviors.


    Use Case:
    Import ML-ready feature vectors from a previously CLASSIFIED and SEGMENTED trial.
    Import coarse ML-ready feature vectors

    Return Various Reaching Kinematic Data Structures
